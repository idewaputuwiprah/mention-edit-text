# Mention Edit Text 
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/idewaputuwiprah/mention-edit-text.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#idewaputuwiprah/mention-edit-text)

An Android library that extends the standard EditText to support @mentions, just like in popular social media apps. It makes it easy to detect, highlight, and manage mentions within your appâ€™s text input fields.

## Getting Started
You can download a jar from GitHub's [releases page][1].

Or use `Gradle` by:

1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file:
```gradle
repositories {
  maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```
2. Add the dependency
```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.idewaputuwiprah:mention-edit-text:0.2'
}
```

## Overview
This is how the library works:

### 1. User Input Detection  
The user types text in `MentionEditText` widget. It automatically detects when the user types the @ character.

### 2. Suggestions Based on Trigger
After the @ character, the library listens for the following text and fetches/display suggestions dynamically based on the typed content. You can use Android's `RecyclerView` to show the suggestion list.

### 3. User Selection
The user taps on one of the suggestions from the suggestion list. 

### 4. Insert & Display
The selected suggestion is inserted into `MentionEditText` widget, replacing the @ trigger and associated text.

## How To Use

### 1. Insert `MentionEditText` widget into your layout  
```xml
<com.adit.library.MentionEditText
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content"
  app:mentionColor="@color/some_color"/>
```
You can customize the mention color using `app:mentionColor` attribute.  

  
### 2. Define `RecyclerView` widget in your layout  
This widget will be used to display the suggestion list. You can see the sample layout [here][2]

  
### 3. Define `RecyclerViewAdapter` and attach it to your `RecyclerView`  
You need to extend `Mention` interface for your items. You can check the sample [here][3]

  
### 4. Implement keyword listener  
You need to implement [listener][4] that will fetch the suggestion list either localy or remotely.
```kotlin
edMention.setOnMentionTriggeredListener { keywords->
  // fetch your suggestion list using the keywords provided
}
```

  
### 5. Show the suggestion to `MentionEditText` widget  
To show the suggestion in the widget, you can use the following method:
```kotlin
edMention.setMention(item) // item is an object that extend Mention interface
```

  
### 6. Get mention objects  
To get mentions object, you can use `getMentions()` method from `MentionEditText` widget:
```kotlin
edMention.getMentions()
```
This will return list of [MentionSpan][5] objects  
  
**You can check the implementation sample [here][6]**
